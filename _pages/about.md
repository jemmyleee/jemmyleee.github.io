Hello, I'm **Jen-Wei Lee** — a former mathematics teacher turned machine learning enthusiast.

Currently, I am pursuing my Master's degree in Data Science at National Cheng Kung University, specializing in Computer Vision and Deep Learning. My research interests include adversarial attacks, image restoration, and model optimization. I am passionate about bridging rigorous mathematical theory with real-world AI applications.

In competitions such as NeurIPS 2024 and the Jane Street Market Prediction Challenge, I have honed my skills in adversarial robustness and predictive modeling. I also contributed to academic research on fractal-based quantization for super-resolution, with a submission to ICCV 2025.

Outside of research, I enjoy exploring new ideas, embracing challenges, and continuously expanding my technical and creative horizons.

Thanks for visiting my website — feel free to reach out!
